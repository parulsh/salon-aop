Assume the following functionalities of the app :
1. A salon owner can register his/her saloon on the application by providing basic details like
1. Company name
2. GSTIN
3. PAN number
4. Address
5. Work schedule (days and hours of operation)
6. Services they provide along with cost of each service and time taken to complete
the service (Example : At saloon A, Haircut - 20 mins and INR 200, Shaving - 15
mins and INR 100. At Saloon B, Haircut - 45 mins and INR 100 and Hair Wax -
120 mins and INR 1000). Different saloons can provide different services.
7. Each saloon also specifies the number of chairs they have available. If a
saloon has 2 chairs, they can take 2 bookings for the same time slot.

Example : if a saloon has 1 chair and receives a booking for a 1 hour Haircut
service for 9 AM, this saloon is occupied from 9 am to 10 am and cannot take
any booking for 9:30 AM as the chair will be occupied.

However, let's say a saloon has 2 chairs and receives a booking for a 1 hour
Haircut service for 9 AM, only one chair in this saloon is occupied from 9 am
to 10 am and the other chair is available. So this saloon can take another
booking for 9 am or 9:30 am as well.

2. All services can only start at 0th or 30th minute of the hour. Example : 10 AM, 10:30 AM,
11 AM, 11:30 AM ....

Bookings cannot start at in between times, say 10:20 AM

3. A customer can see/book services at available time slots for the same day only.

Requirement:
Primary requirement involves you to create the following :
1. Create a Database Schema to reflect the above.
2. Build JSON APIs for the following :
1. For a particular saloon, and a selected service, list time slots available to book.
2. Create a booking for a service at a business.
